# open_cryo_labels_js

 Attempt to make label generation for LCRY-1700 more flexible and cross platform using JS and HTML. So far itwill likely only print/work on chrome but it should hopefully work

# How to use
download the files in [./web_files](./web_files) and open [basic_frame.html](./web_files/basic_frame.html)
in google chrome. sample names are loaded with a text file containing one sample per line.
sample sets are currently implemented with JSON embeded in the html document
this should all be fairly transparent for use though the relevant JSON should be modified.
alternatively a new method of loadig commonly used sample sets should be investigated.
